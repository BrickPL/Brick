## Brick

**BRICK INTRODUCTION GOES HERE**

### Documentation

Brick was designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind.To create your first blockchain write the following line

`blockchain MyBlock = (param1:str, param2:int)`

Voila! Your first blockchain has been created. This blockchain will store a string and an integer. You can create a blockchain with as many parameters as you want. Currently strings and integers are supported. 

Once your blockchain has been initialized, it's now time to add data to it. 

`add MyBlock = (param1:"First time!",param2:25)`

There you go, that easy. The datatype used **must** match the one used when initialized. Consistency is important! Also, very important to understand that this IS NOT A BLOCK. A block contains many of these (what I like to call) _pebbles_, or not, it's up to you.

So you've acummulated enough pebbles, now it's time to mine a block. Even easier.

`mine MyBlock`

MyBlock has been mined. Yeah. Currently the proof of work difficulty is pretty low so it's quick.

So now you're interested on seeing the complete blockchain, simple:

`print MyBlock`

Boom there you go. Printed in its entirety. 

Oh you wanted a file? You didn't want to see it in the console? Good thing this command exists:

`export MyBlock`

A neat json file has been created in your project directory. Huh. Endless possibilities right? Share that blockchain, print the blockchain and hang it on the wall. I don't care, it's your file. Do whatever you want with it.

A very important aspect of the blockchain is missing, decentralization right? Well, Brick kind of has it.

`run MyBlock`

With this command, your blockchain is now hosted in your computer for your local network. People on your network can use your address to see the current blockchain:

http://192.168.1.1/ - Gives the current blockchain

http://192.168.1.1/current - Gives the data that is waiting for a block to be mined

http://192.168.1.1/mine - Mines a block in the blockchain

http://192.168.1.1/data/new - Using Postman, send a json block with the required info for the blockchain to be added to the list

This is a preview of what is to come. Brick should in the future, permit users to connect peer-to-peer and mantain a proper blockchain. The groundwork is there.
